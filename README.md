# housing_price
 king county housing price project, one of my earliest project, delighted to share with you all. [ have included a preview file in html format to make it convenient for small visits ;-) ]

A housing price prediction machine learning project based on king county housing data set, employing Linear Regression and gradient descent techniques which could achieve an accuracy of 72% with least overfitting. 
Hyperparameters used for multivariate Linear Regression with gradient descent learning rate = 0.025, iterations = 500, regularisation hyperparameter = 0
Hyperparameters used for polynomial Linear Regression with gradient descent learning rate = 0.1, iterations = 500, regularisation hyperparameter = 10
